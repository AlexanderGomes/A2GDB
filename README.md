# **Open-Source Database System for Learning**

## **Project Overview**
This open-source DBMS helps students learn database concepts through multiple versions tailored to different skill levels, pick the version you're comfortable with and implement the features you want.

## **Features**
- **Multi-Version Database**: Different levels of the database are available for various skill levels.
- **Custom Implementation**: Students can choose features to implement, allowing flexibility and creativity in problem-solving.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Each version encourages practical application of database concepts such as data storage, indexing, query optimization, and transaction management.
- **Incremental Complexity**: The project starts with fundamental database structures and increases in complexity, introducing more advanced concepts as students progress.

## **Learning Goals**
- **Foundational Knowledge**: Learn about database storage, schemas, tables, and basic indexing techniques.
- **Intermediate Skills**: Understand how to implement B+ trees, query optimizers, and efficient search algorithms.
- **Advanced Topics**: Explore more complex database features such as concurrency control, multi-versioning, and recovery mechanisms.
- **Real-World Application**: Get experience with database design and implementation that mirrors production-level systems.

### **Version Breakdown**
1. **Version 1 (Beginner)**
   - Focuses on basic database operations, simple data storage, and basic querying.
   - Ideal for students new to database systems.

2. **Version 2 (Intermediate)**
   - Introduces indexing, query optimization, and more efficient data retrieval methods.
   - Builds on Version 1, with more complex tasks for students with moderate experience.

3. **Version 3 (Advanced)**
   - Implements advanced features like multi-version concurrency control (MVCC), transaction support, and recovery techniques.
   - Designed for students who want to challenge themselves with real-world database features.
